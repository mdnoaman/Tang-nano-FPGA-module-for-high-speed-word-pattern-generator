# Tang-nano-FPGA-module-for-high-speed-word-pattern-generator
An extemely low cost (5 euros) nano Tang FPGA board is configured to perform very high speed word pattern generator.

The FPGA board (https://github.com/sipeed/Tang-Nano-Doc) comes with a dedicated USB JTAG programmer which also serves the purpose of transfer of data using UART configuration.
